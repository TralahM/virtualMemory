## Implementation of Algorithms

Data structure Used **Hash Table** to keep count of the number of occurrences of
page addresses.

FIFO shows an increase in page faults as the number of frames increases.

The FIFO algorithm is consistent with Bélády's anomaly for FIFO replacement.

Belady's anomaly is observed
